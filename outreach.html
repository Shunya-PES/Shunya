        <h1>MATHBEE</h1>
        <h3>16th September 2022</h3>
        <p class="programtext">
          Bringing out its pearlescent form in all strength in the EC Campus as
          well, Club Shunya honored the Engineersâ€™ Day of the year with yet
          another fun-filled event. On the 16th of September, we organized
          Mathbee: a quiz competition, with a fun twist! Duos and trios of
          participants had to rack their brains to answer logical reasoning
          questions on Math for round one and a game of Bingo for the second
          round. The event proved a huge success.

          On the 29th of October, Shunya held one of the most rewarding events-
          Vicharaprapancha. Vicharaprapancha was a science fair that was held to
          enlighten and upskill government school kids in science and science
          related experiments. Vicharaprapancha was truly one of the most
          grounding, fun-filled events held by Shunya.
